# Formalized Music

## Page 5

From this very general, fundamental point of view, from which we wish
to examine and make music, *primary time appears as a wax or clay on which operations and relations can be inscribed and engraved*, first for the purposes of work, and then for communication with a third person. 

## Page 8

Multiserial music, a fusion of the multimodality of Messiaen and the Viennese school, remained, nevertheless, at the heart of the fundamental problem of music. But by 1954 it was already in the process of deflation, for the completely deterministic complexity of the operations of composition and of the works themselves produced an *auditory and ideological nonsense*.

## On swarms, End of  P 8
But other paths also led to the same stochastic crossroads-first of all, natural events such as the collision of hail or rain with hard surfaces, or the song of cicadas in a summer field. These sonic events are made out of thou- sands of isolated sounds; this multitude of sounds, seen as a totality, is a new sonic event. This

## On the elements of sound, P 43

All sound is an integration of grains, of elementary sonic particles, of sonic quanta. Each of these elementary grains has a threefold nature: duration, frequency, and intensity.1

## On New Kinds of Music, P 43

The second thesis is that stochastics can lead to the creation of new
sonic materials and to new forms. For this purpose we must as a preamble put forward a temporary hypothesis which concerns the nature of sound, of all sound [19]

## On Complex Sounds, Fireworks, P 43

A complex sound may be imagined as a multi-colored firework in which each point of light appears and instantaneously disappears against a black sky. But in this firework there would be such a quantity of points oflight organized in such a way that their rapid and teeming succession would create forms and spirals, slowly unfolding, or conversely, brief explosions setting the whole sky aflame. A line oflight would be created by a sufficiently large multitude of points appearing and dis- appearing instantaneously.

## On using probability to describe state over time, P 49

...just to describe the state of a gaseous mass of greatly reduced volume at one instant t, even if simplifications are allowed at the beginning of the calculation, would require several centuries of human work! This was a false problem because it is useless; and as far as gaseous masses are concerned, the Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic theory of gases, with its statistical method, has been very fruitful [6].

## On composition, creating something from nothing, P 258

In musical composition, construction must stem from originality which can be defined in extreme (perhaps inhuman) cases as the creation of new rules or laws, as far as that is possible; as fur as possible meaning original, not yet known or even forseeable. Construct laws therefore from nothing, since without any causality.

## On temoral schema, P 264

One could say that every temporal schema, pre-conceived or post-conceived, is a representation outside time of the temporal flux in which the phenomena, the entities, are inscribed.

Polyphonic music conceived without an intention that the combined melody lines should form chordal or harmonic combinations
