\section{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}
\TODO{I'll fill this out more as I progress, but this is basically the
  chapter structure I'm imagining. Building the software likely won't
  have enough content for a whole chapter, so I may merge it with the
  math chapter}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction and  Historical Context % context primes for motivation
\item Motivation
\item Framework for multimedia documentation Approach/Computer Systems
\item Describe the Mathematics. % Note that Wikipedia states that
                                % Xenakis pioneered the use of
                                % Set-theory in music. this is a nice
                                % tie in to Set Builder
                                % Notation, which when seen is ungoogleable
\item Build the Software
\item Live multimedia performance
\item Concert playback recording. 
\item Conclusion/Educational Implications
\end{enumerate}
