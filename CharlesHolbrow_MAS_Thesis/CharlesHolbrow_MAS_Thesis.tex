\chapter*{Introduction}

\newthought{In 2004,} the Culture 2000 Programme created by the European union approved a 99510 Euro grant to an Italian Multimedia firm for a project called Virtual Electronic Poem (VEP)\cite{eu2004}. The project proposed to create a virtual reality simulation in which users could experience rendered audio and video of the famous Gesamptkunstwerk created for the Phillips Pavilion at the 1958 World Expo in Brussels. 

The goal of the project is included in the Culture 2000 Programme report:
The project will reproduce the experience created by the Philips pavilion at the Brussels Expo
Universelle in 1958. 

Give Details? Explain all the parts that were involved with the original pavillion, explain all the resources that were reviewed to figure out what the thing actually looked like. 

This project was so involved, that the pricinpal investigator coined the term "Archeology of Multimedia" to describe the experience of recovering\cite{TODO}. 

Virtual reality technology has changed enough between 2004 and 2015, that reviving the VEP project would probably take an additional multimedia archeology expedition.

The problem of preservation described above informs the structure and strategy in this thesis. 

Explain the need for audio systems as computer systems? Cite Granularity. Describe what fields I draw from. Describe how fields can go deep, but Anti Disciplineary is unbounded. Describe how this could only happen at the media lab. Detail how I will granularize?

\section{Hypercompression}
How it fits into audio engineering, compression, how it fits into this project.

\chapter{The Design of Tufte's Books}
\label{ch:tufte-design}


\newthought{The pages} of a book are usually divided into three major
sections: the front matter (also called preliminary matter or prelim), the
main matter (the core text of the book), and the back matter (or end
matter).

\section{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces1}\index{typefaces}
\index{fonts|see{typefaces}}

Tufte's books primarily use two typefaces: Bembo and Gill Sans.  Bembo is used
for the headings and body text, while Gill Sans is used for the title page and
opening epigraphs in \thesis.

\chapter[Chapter2]{Chapter 2!!}
\label{ch:ch2}

\section{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
extensive use of sidenotes.

\section{References}
References are placed alongside their citations as sidenotes,
as well.  This can be accomplished using the normalcite command

\section{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:figures-and-tables}
Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work.

\section{Full-width text blocks}

\section{Typography}\label{sec:typography}

\subsection{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces}\index{typefaces}
If the Palatino, \textsf{Helvetica}, and \texttt{Bera Mono} typefaces are installed, this style
will use them automatically.  Otherwise, we'll fall back on the Computer Modern
typefaces.

\subsection{Letterspacing}\label{sec:letterspacing}
This document class includes two new commands and some improvements on
existing commands for letterspacing.

\section{Document Class Options}\label{sec:options}

\label{ch:troubleshooting}

\section{Errors, Warnings, and Informational Messages}\label{sec:tl-messages}
The following is a list of all of the errors, warnings, and other messages generated by the asdfkj classes and a brief description of their meanings.
