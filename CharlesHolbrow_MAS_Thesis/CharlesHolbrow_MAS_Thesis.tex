\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
\newthought{In 2004,} the Culture 2000 Programme created by the 
European union approved a 99510\EUR{} grant to an Italian Multimedia 
firm for a project called Virtual Electronic Poem (VEP)\cite{eu2004}. 
The project proposed to create a virtual reality simulation in which 
users could experience rendered audio and video of the famous
Gesamtkunstwerk created for the Phillips Pavilion at the 1958 World
Expo in Brussels. 

The goal of the project is included in the Culture 2000 Programme
report: The project will reproduce the experience created by the
Philips pavilion at the Brussels Expo Universelle in 1958.

\TODO{}Give Details? Explain all the parts that were involved with the
original pavilion, explain all the resources that were reviewed to
figure out what the thing actually looked like.

This project was so involved, that the principal investigator coined
the term "Archeology of Multimedia" to describe the experience of
recovering\cite{TODO}.

Virtual reality technology has changed enough between 2004 and 2015,
that reviving the VEP project would probably take an additional
multimedia archeology expedition.

The problem of preservation described above informs the structure and
strategy in this thesis. 

Explain the need for audio systems as computer systems? Cite
Granularity. Describe what fields I draw from. Describe how fields can
go deep, but Anti Disciplinary is unbounded. Describe how this could
only happen at the media lab. Detail how I will granularize?

\section{This it the Title}
\label{sec:this-it-title}
Wow this is the new section@!!!!!


\section{Hypercompression}
How it fits into audio engineering, compression, how it fits into this project. 


\chapter{The Design of Tufte's Books}
\label{ch:tufte-design}


\newthought{The pages} of a book are usually divided into three major
sections: the front matter (also called preliminary matter or prelim), the
main matter (the core text of the book), and the back matter (or end
matter).

\section{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces1}\index{typefaces}
\index{fonts|see{typefaces}}

Tufte's books primarily use two typefaces: Bembo and Gill Sans.  Bembo is used
for the headings and body text, while Gill Sans is used for the title page and
opening epigraphs in \title.

\chapter[Chapter2]{Chapter 2!!}
\label{ch:ch2}

\section{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
extensive use of sidenotes.

\section{References}
References are placed alongside their citations as sidenotes,
as well.  This can be accomplished using the normalcite command

\section{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:figures-and-tables}
Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work.

\section{Full-width text blocks}

\section{Typography}\label{sec:typography}

\subsection{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces}\index{typefaces}
If the Palatino, \textsf{Helvetica}, and \texttt{Bera Mono} typefaces are installed, this style
will use them automatically.  Otherwise, we'll fall back on the Computer Modern
typefaces.

\subsection{Letterspacing}\label{sec:letterspacing}
This document class includes two new commands and some improvements on
existing commands for letterspacing.

\section{Document Class Options}\label{sec:options}

\chapter{Troubleshooting and Support}
\label{ch:troubleshooting}

\section{Errors, Warnings, and Informational Messages}\label{sec:tl-messages}
The following is a list of all of the errors, warnings, and other messages generated by the classes and a brief description of their meanings.
