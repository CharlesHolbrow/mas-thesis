  Thanks to Tod Machover, for your continuous support and
  encouragement, and mentorship; for sharing your process, and for
  help and support integrating \thesis into \textit{Of
    Experience}. Exp Class was amazing.

Thanks to James Andy Moorer and Joe Paradiso for support, guidance
and mentorship.\TODO{verify spelling}

Thanks to Professor Alex Case for the most inspiring my love for
music, audio engineering, and illuminating the magical subtleties of
dynamic range compression, and for (only slightly begrudgingly)
writing me 1000 recomendations letters. No one better suited than you
to be President of the Audio Engineering Society.

Thanks to Wonshik Choi and Niyom Lue for your infinite patience,
guidance, and for welcoming me to MIT in 2008. Only you could have
taught a music major to enjoy linux, DSP, and spectroscopy.

Thanks to Shawn Drost and Markus Phillips for directly and indirectly
giving me confidence as a software developer.

Thanks to my UMass Lowell Piano teachers for taking chance with me,
and putting up with me for four years. Anthony Mele, Elizabeth
Skavish, Bonnie Anderson, and Thomas Stumpf - You believed in me
before I did. I'm probably the only student ever who was lucky enough
to study with all four of you. :P

Thanks to Gene Atwood for being considerate of everyone, and showing
me how important that is\ldots{} And for screaming in to a microphone when
I needed some screams.

Thanks to my roomates at The Red House, and Brainerd Contextual
Cooperative for love and support and home. For feeding me lots of
meals, for perspective, and for tollerating my disfunctional student
lifestyle.

Thanks my team at the MIT Media Lab. Ben Bloomberg for being my peer
and my mentor at the same time. Thanks for inviting me into the Opera
group in 2008 and bringing me back in 2014, making sure I don't go
crazy, and teaching me sooo much audio stuffs. Bryn Bliska, for
concieving Tempo Toy, which I only slightly stole and turned into
stochastic polytempic modulation, for letting me work out the maths,
and for humility, warmth and musical brilliance. Thanks to Rebecca
Kleinberger for infinite support and insight into everything from
maths to hedghogs to humans. David for peace, intensity, and
robots. Akito for your inspiring projects, attitude, wisdom, and
humility. Kelly for unending support, kindness, consideration, and
sense of humor. Simone for taking the ``im'' out of impossible (over
and over and over again).

Thanks to Helen Corless for being amazing supportive even when I am in
the absolute pits of grad student existence. Thank you for always
reminding me what music is really about, and for challenging me like
no one else can.

Thanks to my grandparents for leading by example, and teaching
kindness and dedication, and for endless support in education.

Thanks to Hilary, Giles, and Felicity for always inspiring me with
kindness, honesty, and wisdom. 

And thanks to my parents, Gwen and Mark for forcing me to get an
education before I was wise enough to know I wanted one. Thank you for
all your love and support in everything ever I have ever done.
