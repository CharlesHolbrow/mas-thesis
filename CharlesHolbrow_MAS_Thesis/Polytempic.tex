\chapter{Temporal Domain: \polytempic}
\label{ch:polytempic}

One composer writing rhythmically complex music during the 20th
century was Elliott Carter. Carter developed a technique he called
\textit{tempo modulation}, or \textit{metric modulation} in which his
music would transition from one musical meter to another through a
transitional section that shared aspects of both. While metric
modulation is a technique for changing meter, and \polytempic is a
technique for changing tempo, the former led to the later in a
surprising way. Carter's reputation for complexity in music attracted
the attention of composer and cellist Tod Machover. While Machover was
studying with Carter, he wrote a trio for violin, viola, and cello, in
which each instrument would accelerate or decelerate relative to the
others. The piece turned out to be so difficult that it was impossible
to find anyone who could play it correctly. Faced with this challenge,
Machover saw opportunity:
\begin{quotation}``A sort of lightbulb went off\ldots{} computers are out
  there, and if you have an idea and can learn how to program, you
  should be able to model it.''\cite{Fein2014}
\end{quotation}
If the music is too complex for a human to process, but we can define
it formulaically, we can teach a computer to play sounds that a human
cannot. \polytempic builds on this idea with inspiration from Xenakis.

\section{Stochos}
\label{sec:polytempic-stochos}
In \autoref{ch:introduction} (see figure~\ref{fig:metastasis}) we saw
how Xenakis used ruled surfaces in his composition to compose swarms
of notes that move together, creating stochastic sonorities. The goal
of \polytempic is to enable composition with swarms of tempo
modulations that move in correlated, cohesive patterns. Music with two
or more simultaneous tempos (polytempic music) is itself not a new
concept; many examples exist,\cite{Greschak2003} and were
described in \autoref{ch:background}. Less common is polytempic music
where continuous tempo accelerations or decelerations are defined
relative to each other. This style of music is well-suited to tape
music, because tape machines can play recordings back at variable
rates. However, it is difficult to control the exact point (or phase)
when de-synchronized tape becomes re-aligned. Performative music with
simultaneous tempi that accelerate and decelerate relative to each
other is unusual, but does exist. In a 1971 interview composer Steve
Reich described how he made the transition to performative polytempic
music after working on his tape music composition, \textit{Come Out}:
\begin{quotation}
  ``1966 was a very depressing year. I began to feel like a mad
  scientist trapped in a lab: I had discovered the phasing process
  of Come Out and didn't want to turn my back on it, yet I didn't know
  how to do it live, and I was aching to do some instrumental
  music. The way out of the impasse came by just running a tape loop
  of a piano figure and playing the piano against it to see if in fact
  I could do it. I found that I could, not with the perfection of the
  tape recorder, but the imperfections seemed to me to be interesting
  and I sensed that they might be interesting to listen to.''\cite{Nyman2015}
\end{quotation}
Reich's experience illustrates what other composers and performers
have also encountered: It is quite difficult to perform polytempic
music accurately. In \textit{Piano Phase} Reich has two performers
playing the same 12 tone series on the piano. After a set number of
repetitions through the pattern, one performer begins to play slightly
faster until she is exactly one note ahead of the other performer, at
which point both performers play at the same rate for a time. This
process is repeated and iterated on, creating a live \emph{phasing}
effect without the pitch shifting that would occur when phasing analog
tape. If we compare a live performance\cite{Huisman1989} with a
programatic rendering\cite{Chen2014} of \textit{Piano Phase}, we can
hear how the latter is able to accelerate more smoothly. The
programatic example spends longer on the transitions where the two
parts are out of phase.

\section{Objective}
\label{sec:polytempic-objective}
Steve Reich composed \textit{Piano Phase} for two performers. Through
experimentation, he found that if the music is reasonably simple, two
performers can make synchronized tempo adjustments relative to each
other well enough to yield compelling results. \polytempic allows us
to write music with many more simultaneous tempi. However, the
requirements are probably too demanding for unassisted performers. Our
goal is to compose and audition music where:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Swarms of an arbitrary number of simultaneous tempi
    coexist. 
  \item Each individual player within the swarm can continuously
    accelerate or decelerate individually, but also as a member of a
    cohesive whole. 
  \item Each musical line can converge and diverge at explicit
    points. At each point of convergence the phase of the meter within
    the tempo can be set.
\end{enumerate}
We start by defining a single tempo transition. Consider the following
example (shown in figure~\ref{fig:basic-tempo-change}):
\begin{itemize}
\item Assume we have 2 snare drum players. Both begin playing the same
  beat at 90 BPM in common time.
\item One performer gradually accelerates relative to the other. We want
  to define a continuous tempo curve such that one drummer accelerates
  to 120 BPM.
\item So far, we can easily accomplish this with a simple linear tempo
  acceleration. However, we want the tempo transition to complete
  exactly when \emph{both} drummers are on a down-beat, so the
  combined effect is a 3 over 4 rhythmic pattern. \textbf{Linear
    acceleration results in the transition completing at an arbitrary
    phase.}
\item We want the accelerating drummer to reach the new tempo after
  exactly 20 beats.
\item We also want the acceleration to complete in exactly 16 beats of
  the original tempo, so the drummer playing a constant tempo and the
  accelerating drummer are playing together.
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution}
\label{sec:polytempic-solution}
We are interested in both the number of beats elapsed in the static
tempo \emph{and} in the changing tempo, as well as the absolute
tempo. If we think of the number of beats elapsed as our
\emph{position}, and the tempo as our \emph{rate}, we see how this
resembles a physics problem. If we have a function that describes our
tempo (or rate), we can integrate that function, and the result will
tell us our number of beats elapsed (or position). Given the above
considerations, our tempo curve is defined in terms of 5 constants:
\hfill\break
\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Time $t_0=0$, when the tempo transition begins
  \item A known time, $t_1$, when the tempo transition ends
  \item A known starting tempo: $\dot{x}_0$
  \item A known finishing tempo: $\dot{x}_1$
  \item The number of beats elapsed in the changing tempo between
    $t_0$ and $t_1$: $x_1$
\end{itemize}
\end{fullwidth}
\hfill\break
The tension of the tempo curve determines how many beats elapse during
the transition period. The curve is well-defined for some starting
acceleration $a_0$ and finishing acceleration $a_1$, so we define the
curve in terms of linear acceleration. Using Newtonian notation we can
describe our tempo acceleration as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{accel}
    \ddot{x}_1 = a_0 + a_1t_1
\end{equation}
Integrating linear acceleration (\ref{accel}) yields a quadratic
velocity curve (\ref{bpm}). The velocity curve describes the tempo (in beats per
minute)\marginnote{We must specify the same time units for input
  variables like $t_1$ and $\dot{x_1}$. I prefer \textit{minutes} for
  $t_1$ and \textit{beats per minute} for $\dot{x_1}$ over
  \textit{seconds} and \textit{beats per second}.} with respect to
time.
\begin{equation}
	\label{bpm}
    \dot{x}_1 = \dot{x}_0 + a_0t_1 + \frac{a_1t_1^2}{2}
\end{equation}
Integrating velocity (\ref{bpm}) gives us a function describing
position (the number of beats elapsed with respect to time).
\begin{equation}
	\label{beats-elapsed}
	x_1 = x_0 + \dot{x}_0t_1 + \frac{a_0t_1^2}{2} + \frac{a_1t_1^3}{6}
\end{equation}
With equations (\ref{bpm}) and (\ref{beats-elapsed}), we can solve for our 
two unknowns, $a_0$ and $a_1$. First we solve both equations for $a_1$:
\begin{displaymath}
    \label{a1-solution}
    a_1=
    \frac{-2}{t_1^2}(\dot{x}_0-\dot{x}_1 + a_0t_1)=
    \frac{-6}{t_1^3}(\dot{x}_0-x_1 + \frac{a_0t_1^2}{2})
\end{displaymath}
Assuming $t_1 \neq 0$, we solve this system of equations for $a_0$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{a0-result}
	a_0=\frac{6x_1-2t_1(\dot{x}_1+2\dot{x}_0)}{t_1^2}
\end{equation}
Evaluating (\ref{a0-result}) with our constants gives us our starting
acceleration. Once we have $a_0$ we can solve (\ref{bpm}) for $a_1$, and 
evaluate (\ref{bpm}) with $a_1$ and $a_0$ to describe our changing tempo 
with respect to time.

\section{Stochastic Transitions}
\label{sec:polytempic-implementation}
Equipped with the equations from the previous section, it becomes quite
simple to create swarms of parallel tempos that are correlated and
complex. In figure~\ref{fig:polytempic-transition} we build on the
previous example. Here, each additional tempo curve is calculated the
same way, except $x_1$ (number of beats in our accelerating tempo
during the transition) is incremented for each additional tempo line. 
\begin{figure*}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{stochastic-tempi.png}
  \caption{Stochastic Tempo Transition from 90~BPM to 120~BPM. Black
    dots are beats in our changing tempi. Grey dots show a
    continuation of beats at the initial tempo.
    $12 \leq x_1 \leq 20$}
  \label{fig:polytempic-transition}
\end{figure*}\hfill\break
This pattern clearly exhibits controlled chance that Xenakis would
describe as \emph{stochastic}. On the very first beat at $t=0$, all
parallel parts are aligned. Beats 2 and 3 can be heard as discrete
rhythmic events, but become increasingly indistinct. The end of beat 4
then overlaps with the start of beat 5, before articulated beats
transition to pseudo random noise. By beat 13 of the static tempo, the
chaos of the many accelerating tempi begin to settle back into order
before returning to complete synchronicity at $t=16$.

\section{Tide: Composition with \polytempic}
\label{sec:composition}
An earlier version of the equation derived here was packaged as a
patch for the Max\sidenote{https://cycling74.com/products/max/}
graphical programming language. Composer Bryn Bliska developed a user
interface and used it in the composition of
\textit{Tide}.\sidenote{Available online:
  \url{http://web.media.mit.edu/~holbrow/mas/Tide_Bliska_Holbrow.wav}}
While this ealier version of the equation did not support a variable
$x_1$ parameter, \textit{Tide} uses \polytempic to drive the phasing
tempos of the bell-like synthesizers throughout the piece for two to
three simultaneous tempi.

\section{Recent Polytempic Work}
\label{sec:polytempic-prior-work}
Many commercial and research projects deal with different ways to
manipulate rhythm and tempo. Flexible digital audio workstations
(DAWs) like Cockos Reaper\sidenote{\url{http://www.reaper.fm}} and
MOTU Digital
Performer\sidenote{\url{http://www.motu.com/products/software/dp}}
include features for auditioning tracks or music-objects with unique
simultaneous tempi, and individual tempos can even be automated
relative to each other. However, the precise non-linear tempo curves
that are required for the syncopated musical content to synchronize
correctly after a transition completes are not possible in any DAW we
tried. Audio programming languages like Max and
SuperCollider\sidenote{\url{http://supercollider.github.io/}} could be used
to create tempo swarms, but require equations like the ones defined in
section~\ref{sec:polytempic-solution}. One project, \textit{Realtime
  Representation and Gestural Control of Musical
  Polytempi}\cite{Nash2008} demonstrates an interface for generating
Polytempic music, but is not intended or capable of generating
coordinated or stochastic tempi swarms.  \textit{The Beatbug
  Network}\cite{Weinberg2002} is described as a multi-user interface
for creating stochastic music, but is focused on ``beats,'' or musical
rhythmic patterns, and timbres, rather than
tempi. \textit{Stochos}\cite{Bokesoy2003} is a software synthesizer
for generating sound using random mathematical distributions, but is
also not designed to work with simultaneous tempos or even as a rhythm
generator. Finally, \textit{Polytempo Network}\cite{Kocher2014} is a
project that facilitates the performance of polytempic music, but does
not aid the composition thereof.
