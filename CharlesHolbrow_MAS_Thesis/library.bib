@article{Zotter2009,
abstract = {This work demonstrates a comprehensive methodology for capture, analy- sis, manipulation, and reproduction of spatial sound-radiation. As the challenge herein, acoustic events need to be captured and reproduced not only in one but in a preferably complete multiplicity of directions, instead. The solutions presented in this work are using the soap-bubble model, a working hypothesis about sound- radiation, and are based on fundamental mathematical descriptions of spherical acoustic holography and holophony. These descriptions enable a clear methodic approach of sound-radiation capture and reproduction. In particular, this work illustrates the implementation of surrounding spherical microphone arrays for the capture of sound-radiation, as well as the analysis of sound-radiation with a func- tional model. Most essential, the thesis shows how to obtain holophonic reproduc- tion of sound-radiation. For this purpose, a physical model of compact spherical loudspeaker arrays is established alongside with its electronic control.},

@article{Zotter2009a,
abstract = {In discrete spherical loudspeaker and microphone arrays, sampling strategies for the sphere need to be considered. Even more, since spherical arrays have been applied in several sound field analysis and synthesis tasks recently. However, sampling the sphere is not as easy, and hardly ever as simple and efficient, as equi-spaced sampling the circle. In fact, there are only a few equi-spaced sampling layouts, which have narrow limitations in terms of Fourier (spherical harmonics) analysis. As sampling causes aliasing in the Fourier domain, and most applications in acoustics are based on this domain, it has to be payed considerable attention. This paper discusses the properties of several sampling strategies on the sphere found in literature. Essentially, the impact of aliasing on incident and radiating field representations, as well as practical issues (numerical conditioning, sampling efficiency) are briefly discussed.},
