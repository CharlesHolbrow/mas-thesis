abstract = {Vocal Vibrations is a new project by the Opera of the Future group at the MIT Media Lab that seeks to engage the public in thoughtful singing and vocalizing, while exploring the relationship between human physiology and the resonant vibrations of the voice. This paper describes the motivations, the technical implementation, and the experience design of the Vocal Vibrations public installation. This installation consists of a space for reflective listening to a vocal composition (the Chapel) and an interactive space for personal vocal exploration (the Cocoon). In the interactive experience, the participant also experiences a tangible exteriorization of his voice by holding the ORB, a handheld device that translates his voice and singing into tactile vibrations. This installation encourages visitors to explore the physicality and expressivity of their voices in a rich musical context.},

abstract = {In this article, we study the evolution of music level and music level variation between 1967 and 2011. To do so, we suggest a set of signal features, and examine the impact of limiters and compressors on a corpus of music tracks. As a result, we find that some of the dynamic processes used during music production may be retrieved from the signal. Then, we examine the evolution of studio practices in relation to dynamic processing during the past five decades, as well as the evolution of the relevant signal features. In particular, this results in a characterization of the loudness war. We find for instance that it may have peaked in 2004, resulted in reduction of peak salience, but did not result in any reduction of long-term musical dynamics. 0},

abstract = {A process model of hypertext reading was used to generate predictions about the effects of hypertext features on cognitive processing during text navigation and comprehension. We evaluated the predictions of the model with respect to the extant literature, focusing on studies in which versions of hypertexts were compared. Consistent with our predictions, the increased demands of decision-making and visual processing in hypertext impaired reading performance. Individual differences in readers, such as working memory capacity and prior knowledge, mediated the impact of hypertext features. For example, readers with low working memory and low prior knowledge were usually disadvantaged in hypertext. Some benefits were observed for learners with low prior knowledge, however, if the hypertext structure was hierarchical and consistent with that of the knowledge domain. We also surveyed the effectiveness of structural features designed to reduce cognitive load, including graphical overviews, restricted access to links, and visible link types. Complex graphical overviews did not reliably enable learning and navigation, whereas navigational support from restricted access and visible link types were helpful. We identified gaps in the empirical literature and suggested future studies to investigate cognitive processes in hypertext reading. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper the assumption of cognitive overhead in hypermedia learning is specified by cognitive load theory. This analysis is based on different types of cognitive load, the dimension of linearity/non-linearity as well as text characteristics. We propose a model stating that extraneous cognitive load in hypermedia learning is basically determined by the interaction of text presentation format (linear/non-linear) with text type (text with and without narrative structures). This assumption was tested by means of a 2 ?? 2 experimental design. Sixty participants completed a computer-based learning program that contained a narrative text or an encyclopaedia text in either linear or non-linear presentation format. Results confirm the suggested interaction hypothesis postulating that non-linear information presentation of narrative text structure increases cognitive load and decreases knowledge acquisition. However, for encyclopaedia text participants' knowledge acquisition was not affected by linear or non-linear presentation format. Furthermore, results suggest a cross-validation of cognitive load measures and propositional analysis. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As the challenge herein, acoustic events need to be captured and reproduced not only in one but in a preferably complete multiplicity of directions, instead. The solutions presented in this work are using the soap-bubble model, a working hypothesis about sound- radiation, and are based on fundamental mathematical descriptions of spherical acoustic holography and holophony. These descriptions enable a clear methodic approach of sound-radiation capture and reproduction. In particular, this work illustrates the implementation of surrounding spherical microphone arrays for the capture of sound-radiation, as well as the analysis of sound-radiation with a func- tional model. Most essential, the thesis shows how to obtain holophonic reproduc- tion of sound-radiation. For this purpose, a physical model of compact spherical loudspeaker arrays is established alongside with its electronic control.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of leads (or hypertext node previews) on cognitive load and learning. Leads provided a brief summary of information in the linked node, which helped orient the reader to the linked information. Dependent variables included measures of cognitive load: self-report of mental effort, reading time, and event-related desynchronization percentage of alpha, beta and theta brain wave rhythms; and learning performance: a recall task, and tests of domain and structural knowledge. Results indicated that use of leads reduced brain wave activity that may reflect split attention and extraneous cognitive load, and improved domain and structural knowledge acquisition. Further, findings provide insights into differentiating the types of cognitive load apparent in hypertext-assisted learning environments. Use of EEG measures allowed examination of instantaneous cognitive load, which showed that leads may be influencing germane load-reducing mental burden associated with creating coherence between two linked node. The self-report of mental effort measure appears more closely associated with overall and intrinsic load.},

However, sampling the sphere is not as easy, and hardly ever as simple and efficient, as equi-spaced sampling the circle. In fact, there are only a few equi-spaced sampling layouts, which have narrow limitations in terms of Fourier (spherical harmonics) analysis. As sampling causes aliasing in the Fourier domain, and most applications in acoustics are based on this domain, it has to be payed considerable attention. This paper discusses the properties of several sampling strategies on the sphere found in literature. Essentially, the impact of aliasing on incident and radiating field representations, as well as practical issues (numerical conditioning, sampling efficiency) are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Over the last century, composers have made increasingly ambitious experiments with musical time, but have been impeded in expressing more temporally-complex musical processes by the limitations of both music notations and human performers. In this paper, we describe a computer-based notation and gestural control system for independently manipulating the tempi of musical parts within a piece, at performance time. We describe how the problem was approached, drawing upon feedback and suggestions from consultations across multiple disciplines, seeking analogous problems in other fields. Throughout, our approach is guided and, ultimately, assessed by an established professional composer, who was able to interact with a working prototype of the system.},

abstract = {There is a widespread belief that the increasing use of dynamic range compression in music mastering (the loudnesswar) deteriorates sound quality but experimental evidence of perceptual effects is lacking. In this study, normal hearing listeners were asked to evaluate popular music recordings in original versions and in remastered versions with higher levels of dynamic range compression. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of preference for the less compressed music. We also failed to find differences in ratings of perceived "depth" between the original and more compressed audio. A low degree of response consistency between different presentations of the same music suggests that listeners are less sensitive to even high levels of dynamic range compression than often argued. 0},

In order to convey the tempo, an animation is used that resembles the gestures of a conductor, which is believed to be particularly comprehensible for musicians. This system offers an alternative to the use of a click track which is still the most common means for the purpose of synchronization. The possibility to combine several devices in a network allows for the synchronization of several players in ensemble music. It is hoped that this system promotes the creation and performance of music that exhibit ambitious tempo polyphony as well as spatial distribution of the musicians.},

This was recognized by DeStefano and LeFevre [DeStefano, D., \& LeFevre, J. -A., (2007). Cognitive load in hypertext reading: A review. Computers in Human Behavior, 23(3), 1616-1641.] who predicted an increase of cognitive load and impairment of learning for hypertexts with a higher number of links per page. From a practical perspective, several navigation support techniques, such as providing link suggestions, have been proposed for guiding learners and reducing cognitive overload. In an experiment, we tested DeStefano and LeFevre's predictions as well as the usefulness of link suggestions. Participants used different versions of a hypertext, either with 3-links or 8-links per page, presenting link suggestions or not. We tested their cognitive load and learning outcomes. Results showed that there was a benefit of using link suggestions for learning, but no effect of number of links on learning was found. Moreover, the effects of our manipulations on cognitive load were mediated by the reading order that participants selected. Implications for research and the design of navigation support systems are discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Encompasses 18 years of conceptual and practical innovations that the author has made in musical composition. Chapter 1 denounces the narrow deterministic techniques of linear serial music and introduces 1) the 'mass' concept (sonic events produced in great number, e.g., clouds of pizzicati, glissandi, etc.) and 2) probability theory (stochastic music). Examples are taken from architecture (shell structure with ruled surfaces) and music (Metastasis, Pithoprakta, Achorripsis for orchestra; Diamorphoseis for tape). In Poisson, and Gauss, laws are introduced to calculate the global instrumental composition and the parameters of each note (pitch, attack, duration, intensity, form, timbre, ways of performing). Chapters 2 and 3 introduce the combination of 1) Markov chains with 2) the concept of the 'quantic' nature of sound at a macroscopic as well as at a microscopic level (Syrmos and Analogiques A and B for orchestra and tape). Chapter 4 introduces game theory and linear programming in order to create a new form based on conflict (Duel and Strategy, each for 2 orchestras and 2 conductors). Chapter 5 gives and explains the ST-Program in FORTRANSIV which makes it possible, given specific input data, to engender a large family of stochastic instrumental or electracoustic compositions. Chapter 6 attempts to uncover the ordered and group structures of musical thought and practice and introduces set theory and functions of logic into composition (Herma for piano). Chapter 7 uses Aristoxenian and Byzantine music theory to develop outside-of-time and in-time structures by formalizing and generalizing any scale through logical calculus ('sieve theory'). Chapter 8 identifies musical evolution with the Pythago-Parmenidean current of thought and describes a deterministic musical structure based on finite groups (analysis of Nomos Alpha for cello and Nomos Gamma for large orchestra). Chapter 9 proposes to replace harmonic analysis (Fourier series) in sound synthesis (produced by computers coupled with digital-to-analogue converters) with random walks, that is, with a space of probability distributions.},

abstract = {The Beatbugs are hand-held percussive instruments that allow the creation, manipulation, and sharing of rhythmic motifs through a simple interface. When multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other's motifs. Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized "Nerve Center" to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension between the system's stochastic routing scheme and the players' improvised real-time decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical experience. A musical composition entitled "Nerve" was written for the system by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover's Toy Symphony [1] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted by Kent Nagano. The paper concludes with a short evaluative discussion of the concert and the weeklong workshops that led to it.},
