\chapter*{Abstract}
\label{ch:abstract}
The theory of stochastic music proposes that we think of music as a vertical
integration of mathematics, the physics of sound, psychoacoustics, and
traditional music theory. In \textit{\thesis, \subtitle} we explore
the design and implementation of three innovative musical projects
that build on a deep vertical integration of science and technology in
different ways: \refmod, \polytempic, and \thesis.  The \refmod
introduces an interface for quickly sketching abstract architectural
and musical ideas. \polytempic proposes a mathematical approach for
composing previously inaccessible polytempic music. \thesis describes
new technique for manipulating music in space and time. For each
project, we examine how stochastic theory can help us discover and
explore new musical possibilites, and we discuss the advantages and
shortcomings of this approach.
