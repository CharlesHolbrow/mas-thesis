# Hypercompressor

Finish introduction

Add side chain compression into

Transforms like rotation and zoom.

Rotation transforms are the key. How we can take a transform, and rotate it to get a better effect. 

Describe what I actually did. (Which parts of the compressor need tobe re-considered?)

# Performance

New chapter -(update link in introduction)

Lots of Spatial Sound stuff in Hyper compression section. Use material
from thesis proposal

# ok

Add Chandelier Stuff to Intro. 
 
Check subtitle from website - I can still change th title - Add new
sub title. 

#Conclusion

Story about the phillips pavilion virtual reality revival
project.

They built a custom sequencer that was capable of controlling the 180
channels of lighting and visual effects. 

Go on to say that we need interdisciplineary

Find the balance - let the computers do the formulaic things. Let the
people do the feeling things. 

# Fit this in somewhere
After World War II, compositional tastes where changing. One reaction
to serialism was that of Stockhausen and Boulez. Both composers turned
to \textit{Aleatoric Music}, in which the overall structure of the
music was arefully composed, but smaller details were left to
\TODO{This is either misleading, or not true. Boulez was REALLY into
pure chance.}
chance, essetially reducing the impact of the mathematics of chance on
the composition.

Some composers reacted to the serialism by Xenakis had the opposite reaction. Xenakis saw how we
could mathematically paramaterize chance, and create sonorities that
arise from statistical means without depending on pure chance. 

# If there's time:
THe Architecture and Music in Space and Time section is too long. put
it somewhere else?

# Also in Ref Mod 
We know that Xenakis turned to curved surfaces because he wanted to
avoid x

He probably actually wanted difuse reflections,

But if his use of reflections had been intentional, how would he have
used them?
