# Hypercompressor

Transforms like rotation and zoom.  Rotation transforms are the
key. How we can take a transform, and rotate it to get a better
effect.  Describe what I actually did. (Which parts of the compressor
need tobe re-considered?)


# Performance

New chapter -(update link in introduction)

Lots of Spatial Sound stuff in Hyper compression section. Use material
from thesis proposal

# ok

Add Chandelier Stuff to Intro. 
 
Check subtitle from website - I can still change th title - Add new
sub title. 

#Conclusion

Story about the phillips pavilion virtual reality revival
project.

They built a custom sequencer that was capable of controlling the 180
channels of lighting and visual effects. 

Go on to say that we need interdisciplineary

Find the balance - let the computers do the formulaic things. Let the
people do the feeling things.

The easy work has been done. People are familiar with echo, phasing,
distortion, the basic effects that we can buy in prepackaged
collections or multieffects boxes don't help us 

# Fit this in somewhere

Some composers reacted to the serialism by Xenakis had the opposite reaction. Xenakis saw how we
could mathematically paramaterize chance, and create sonorities that
arise from statistical means without depending on pure chance. 

# If there's time:
THe Architecture and Music in Space and Time section is too long. put
it somewhere else?

# Also in Ref Mod 
We know that Xenakis turned to curved surfaces because he wanted to
avoid x

He probably actually wanted difuse reflections,

But if his use of reflections had been intentional, how would he have
used them?
