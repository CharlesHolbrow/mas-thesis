# Fit this in somewhere:
After World War II, compositional tastes where changing. One reaction
to serialism was that of Stockhausen and Boulez. Both composers turned
to \textit{Aleatoric Music}, in which the overall structure of the
music was arefully composed, but smaller details were left to
chance, essetially reducing the impact of the mathematics of chance on
the composition. Xenakis had the opposite reaction. Xenakis saw how we
could mathematically paramaterize chance, and create sonorities that
arise from statistical means without depending on chance.
